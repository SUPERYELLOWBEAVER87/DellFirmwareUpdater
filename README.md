## Introduction :wave:
This program fully automates updating BIOS Firmware on Dell specific machines through the usage of Selenium. The program works by using selenium to download the latest firmware update from Dell's warranty and contracts, then launching the program through CMD. The practicality of this is mostly so that system administrators and IT managers can fully automate updating firmware in large computer labs that have different versions and models of Dell machines.

## Requirements
The program is packaged and compiled with PyInstaller into a portable standalone executable. Chromium is used as the web driver of choice for this project.
### Development Environment
* Selenium
* webdriver_manager
* PySimpleGUI
